# HTML-and-CSS-Reflection
Mockup of the Netmatters landing page created in response to a task.

--TODO--

Create header with netmatters logo, support and contact link buttons, search form and burger menu.

!! The burger menu is to be static !!

Stylized nav bar that highlights with color and a sub nav below with links.

!! Skip making slider and slide bar for now. !!

Place banner image below nav bar
Image should have text over the top including an h1 and an h2.
Call to action button underneath with text "find out more".

Break-points: 

768px or less will push the search form to a new line and replace the support and contact buttons with a 3cx dial link represented by a small phone icon

768px or higher will hide the navbar and the support and contact buttons

at 992px or higher everything will be displayed as first described
